# Portfolio
My name is Kyle Geary and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. This portfolio will show examples of some work I have completed in Computer Science courses working with C, Java, and Python, as well as past work experience researching and practicing quantum computing. It will also include some information about my goals and values to give a sense of who I am personally.
